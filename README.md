## I'm unemployed!

Thank goodness I am enrolled in the UC Berkeley coding boot camp, which will help me land the perfect job. Already I've learned how to make an online quiz for myself. I will continue to update this page as I learn new things, but already I have so many mad skills to show off. 


# code-quiz

As a coding boot camp student, I want to make a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals and keep track of my scores as I practice. This way I can see where I need to spend more time stydying. 

When I click the start button on my code quiz a timer will start and I will be presented with my first question. When I answer a question right, any time I have left on the countdown will be my score. When I answer wrong, my score will decrease by 2 points. If I don't answer at all I will get 0 points. When I am done I can save my initials and my score on a leaderboard. 


## What I did

- Created an object to handle high scores
  - Read from localStorage on page load to check for any existing scores
  - Updated localStorage with current user score
  - Prompted the user to enter initials and store into localStorage
- Created an object that updates the DOM with which stage of the quiz we're on (intro, quiz, end)
- Created an object that handles quiz questions
  - Replaced the prev question markup with current question markup
  - Handled answers with correct or incorrect/notify the user
  - Handled updating score
  - Handled timer
  - Built out the markup for individual questions


# Fun New Learnings
- string literal (vs template literal) 
- string interpolation
- TODO

It is your responsibility to include a note in the README section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code in which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant. This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstance in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized.

If you are struggling with a Challenge or any aspect of the curriculum, please remember that there are student support services available for you:

Office hours facilitated by your TA(s)

Tutor sessions (sign upLinks to an external site.)
