## I'm unemployed!

Thank goodness I am enrolled in the UC Berkeley coding boot camp, which will help me land the perfect job. Already I've learned how to make simple daily scheduler so I can keep track of my study schedule. I will continue to update this page as I learn new things, but already I have so many mad skills to show off. 

As someone with a busy schedule
I want to add important events to a daily planner
So that I can manage my time effectively

When using my planner, I can see the current date displayed at the top of the page.
When I scroll down I can see blocks of time, with colors to make it easy to see future hours vs past or present hours. I can enter an event into any hour block and save it there, so that when I refresh the page I don't need to start all over.
