It is your responsibility to include a note in the README section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code in which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant. This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstance in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized.

If you are struggling with a Challenge or any aspect of the curriculum, please remember that there are student support services available for you:

Office hours facilitated by your TA(s)

Tutor sessions (sign upLinks to an external site.)
